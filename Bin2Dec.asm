//Your program will accept only six keys from the keyboard:  0, 1, Enter, Backspace, c, and q 
//(Note: Enter is ASCII decimal 128 and Backspace is ASCII decimal 129). Any other input will be ignored.
//
//Your program will accept and display 16 binary digits (although the user can Backspace at any point to
// make corrections) followed by an Enter. If a Backspace is input, then the previous input digit will be
// erased (on the display and optionally in memory). If more than 16 bits are entered, then anything
// after 16 will be ignored (and not displayed). If c is entered at any time, then the entire line 
//(and optionally in memory) will be cleared. If q is entered at any time, then your program will clear
// the line and terminate (i.e. go into an infinite loop) immediately.
//
//Once the Enter is received after the 16 binary digits, your program will output a right arrow (a minus
// - followed by greater than >) followed by the decimal equivalent (with a + for positive numbers,
// including zero,  and a - for negative numbers and NO leading spaces) and will then wait for an Enter
// (ignoring any other input except c for clear and q for quit). Once an Enter is received, the displayed
// line will be cleared and your program will wait for new binary digit input
